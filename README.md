# Contao CMS - Display More Articles from the Current Category
More articles is an extension for the Contao CMS(version 3.5.x) witch display more articles from the current category.

In the templates/mod_more_articles.html5 i present the articles with a teaser image. If you need to do the same you have to install a contao module
which gives teaser image features.
Otherwise you can present the articles only with links.

Please open pull requests or contact me with ideas how to improve this Contao Module.
